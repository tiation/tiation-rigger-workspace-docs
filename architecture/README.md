# Architecture Guide

## System Overview

The RiggerConnect-RiggerJobs-Workspace is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for job matching in the construction industry. It consists of mobile applications and a backend server that uses various microservices to handle different business logic components.

## Key Components

### RiggerConnect App (Business Application)
- **Purpose**: Used by construction businesses to post jobs, manage workers, and track projects.
- **Technology**: Built using React Native and TypeScript for cross-platform support on Android and iOS.
- **Integration**:
  - Stripe for payment processing
  - Firebase for real-time notifications

### RiggerJobs App (Worker Application)
- **Purpose**: Used by workers to find jobs, manage availability, and view earnings.
- **Technology**: React Native and TypeScript, providing intuitive and responsive interfaces for users.

### AutomationServer (Backend)
- **Purpose**: Manages all business logic, API services, and automation for job matching and compliance.
- **Technology**:
  - Node.js and Express for building microservices
  - MongoDB for data storage
  - Redis for caching
  - AWS Lambda and S3 for serverless document processing
  - AI-powered job matching and worker ranking

## Microservices Architecture

Each service in AutomationServer is designed as an independent unit with specific responsibilities, enabling horizontal scaling and resilience to component failures.

### API Gateway
- **Purpose**: Routes incoming requests to appropriate microservices, handles authentication, and rate limiting.
- **Technology**: Express with JWT-based authentication and express-rate-limit.

### Job Management Service
- **Purpose**: Responsible for creating, updating, and managing job postings, along with matching workers.
- **Technology**: Uses MongoDB for persistence, and a machine learning model for worker-job matching based on specific metrics.

### Worker Management Service
- **Purpose**: Manages worker profiles, certifications, availability schedules, and compliance verification.
- **Technology**: Integrates with external compliance databases for real-time verification.

### Payment Processing Service
- **Purpose**: Handles all payment transactions between businesses and workers, including fees and automatic payouts.
- **Technology**: Integrates with Stripe API for secure payment processing and uses AWS Lambda for webhook handling.

### Notification Service
- **Purpose**: Sends real-time notifications to users about job status changes, payments, and alerts.
- **Technology**: Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications on mobile platforms; AWS SES for email notifications.

## Infrastructure and CI/CD

The Infrastructure components are managed using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and CI/CD pipelines are configured using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment to AWS.

### Key Infrastructure Elements
- **VPC and Subnets**: Configured for network isolation and security
- **Load Balancers**: Distribute incoming traffic uniformly across available servers
- **Auto-scaling Groups**: Adjusts resource allocation based on demand
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Using AWS CloudWatch and Sentry for monitoring, alerting, and error reporting

## Deployment and Scaling

The platform is designed for performance and high availability with deployment configurations that cater to different environments (development, staging, production).

- **Build and Deploy**: Automated build and deployment scripts with build versions, rollback capabilities, and zero-downtime releases.
- **Scaling Practices**: Horizontally scales critical services to manage increased load while maintaining performance metrics.

## Security and Compliance

Security is paramount within the RiggerConnect ecosystem. Implementing JWT for authentication, encryption at rest for sensitive data, and regular security audits are part of the security strategy.

### Compliance Standards
- **GDPR**: Ensuring data protection and privacy
- **PCI DSS**: Secure payment transactions
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Managed security controls for both logical and physical access
